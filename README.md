# Mock generator

A little pipeline to generate mock galaxy bidimensional brightness distributions in real images. The brightness profiles follow simple single SÃ©rsic models.

For now, it needs the installation of IMFIT (https://www.mpe.mpg.de/~erwin/code/imfit/)

PS: In the current form, the absolute magnitudes are sampled from an empirical distribution.
